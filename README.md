Currently using Bootstrap 4.0.0-alpha.2 (CSS only version)

## What is JBST4?
JBST4 is a blank WordPress theme built with Bootstrap 4.

JBST4 is intended to be used as a starter theme, not as a parent or theme framework. In almost all instances we would recommend you just hack away and customise JBST4 itself.

To add custom CSS you need to download the Sass version. And then edit the Sass files (assets/scss/app.scss being the most important) and recompile.

### Installation

[Download the latest version as .zip file](https://github.com/bassjobsen/jbst-4/archive/master.zip). Upload the .zip file to your WordPress theme directory (wp-content/themes) or use Install theme function in your dashboard. Activate the theme in your dashboard ( Appearence > themes ).
